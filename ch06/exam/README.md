# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
My lab draws a nice little pig and for some reason when I was doing it the command to get just the pig pink so I made evrything pink

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
none my pig draws even though it looks like a slightly deformed pig
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
lots of googling because I knew there would have to be better commands for drawing like the elipse and circle 
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
Kind of wondering why we never learned the draw shape commands for turtle
