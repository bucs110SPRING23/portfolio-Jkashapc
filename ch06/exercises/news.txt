Marijuana refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the Cannabis sativa or
Cannabis indica plant. The plant contains the mind-altering chemical THC and other similar
compounds. Extracts can also be made from the cannabis plant (see "Marijuana Extracts").
According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, cannabis (marijuana) is one of the
most used drugs in the United States, and its use is widespread among young people. In
2021, 35.4% of young adults aged 18 to 25 (11.8 million people) reported using marijuana
in the past year. According to the monitoring of the future survey, rates of past year marijuana 
use among middle and high school students have remained relatively steady ince the late 1990s.
